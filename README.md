Counting Crossing - Free Graphs

Final paper for the course First Steps in Research for Outstanding Students.
Conducted under the supervision of Prof. Micha Sharir.

Improved the running time of an algorithm counting plane graphs for the case of relatively small convex hull, and presented an algorithm for counting cycle covers on a given set of points in the plane.
